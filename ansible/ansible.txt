Pre-requisites
An AWS EC2 instance (on Control node)

Installation steps:
Amazon EC2 instance: Install python and python-pip

yum install python
yum install python-pip

Install ansible using pip check for version
pip install ansible
ansible --version

Create a directory /etc/ansible and create an inventory file called "hosts" add control node and managed hosts IP addresses to it.
mkdir /etc/ansible

Create a user called ansadmin (on Control node and Managed host)
useradd ansadmin
passwd ansadmin

Below command grant sudo access to ansadmin user. But we strongly recommended using "visudo" command if you are aware vi or nano editor. (on Control node and Managed host)
echo "ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers

Ansible server is used to create images and store on docker registry. Therefore install docker, start docker services and add ansadmin to the docker group.
# yum install docker -y

# start docker services 
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker

# add user to docker group 
usermod -aG docker ansadmin
id ansadmin

# Enable Password based authentication
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

PasswordAuthentication yes
save the file and restart the ssh service
systemctl restart sshd

Log in as a ansadmin user on master and generate ssh key (on Control node)
sudo su - ansadmin
ssh-keygen

Copy keys onto all ansible managed hosts (on Control node)
ssh-copy-id ansadmin@<target-server>



Validation test
Run ansible command as ansadmin user it should be successful (Master)
ansible all -m ping
